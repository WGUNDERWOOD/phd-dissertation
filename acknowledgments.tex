I am extremely fortunate to have been surrounded by many truly wonderful people
over the course of my career, and without their support this dissertation would
not have been possible. While it is impossible for me to identify every one of
them individually, I would like to mention a few names in particular to
recognize those who have been especially important to me during the last few
years.

Firstly, I would like to express my utmost gratitude to my Ph.D.\ adviser,
Matias Cattaneo. Working with Matias has been genuinely inspirational for me,
and I could not have asked for a more rewarding start to my journey as a
researcher. From the very beginning, he has guided me expertly through my
studies, providing hands-on assistance when required while also allowing me the
independence necessary to develop as an academic. I hope that, during the four
years we have worked together, I have acquired just a fraction of his formidable
mathematical intuition, keen attention to detail, boundless creativity, and
inimitable pedagogical skill. Alongside his role as my adviser, Matias has been
above all a friend, who has been in equal measure inspiring,
insightful, dedicated, understanding, and kind.

Secondly, I would like to thank all of the faculty members at Princeton and
beyond who have acted as my collaborators and mentors, without whom none of my
work could have been realized. In particular, I express my gratitude to my
tireless Ph.D.\ committee members and letter writers Jianqing Fan and Jason
Klusowski, my coauthors Yingjie Feng and Ricardo Masini, my dissertation reader
Boris Hanin, my teachers
Amir Ali Ahmadi, Ramon van Handel, Mikl{\'o}s R{\'a}cz, and Mykhaylo Shkolnikov,
my colleagues Sanjeev Kulkarni and Roc{\'i}o Titiunik,
and my former supervisor Mihai Cucuringu.
I am also thankful for the staff members at Princeton who have been
perpetually helpful, and I would like to identify Kim
Lupinacci in particular; her assistance in all things administrative has been
invaluable.

I am grateful to my fellow graduate students in the ORFE department for their
technical expertise and generosity with their time, and for making Sherrerd
Hall such a vibrant and exciting space, especially

Our
regular social events made a contribution to my well-being which is difficult
to overstate. My thanks extend also to the students I taught, as
well as to my group of senior thesis undergraduates, for their commitment,
patience, and responsiveness.

More broadly, I would like to thank all of my friends, near and far,
for their unfailing support and reliability, and for
helping to create so many of my treasured memories. In particular,

Thank you to the Princeton Chapel Choir for being such a wonderful
community of musicians and a source of close friends,
and to our directors, Nicole Aldrich and Penna Rose, and organist Eric Plutz.

Lastly, yet most importantly, I want to thank my family for their unwavering
support throughout my studies. My visits back home have been a source of joy
throughout my long and often challenging Ph.D., and I cherish every moment I
have spent with my parents, sister, grandparents, and extended family.
