** Contribution to the dissertation
*** I am the main author of the three papers
*** upon which this dissertation is based.
*** For each of these works, I conducted most of the
*** investigative research,
*** direction determination, literature review, technical writing,
*** manuscript preparation, and critical revision.
*** The introductory sections of the dissertation are entirely my own.
