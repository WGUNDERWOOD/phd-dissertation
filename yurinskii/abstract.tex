Yurinskii's coupling is a popular theoretical tool for non-asymptotic
distributional analysis in mathematical statistics and applied probability,
offering a Gaussian strong approximation with an explicit error bound under
easily verified conditions.
Originally stated in $\ell^2$-norm for sums of independent random vectors, it
has recently been extended both to the $\ell^p$-norm,
for $1 \leq p \leq \infty$, and to vector-valued martingales in
$\ell^2$-norm, under some strong conditions.
We present as our main result a Yurinskii coupling for approximate
martingales in $\ell^p$-norm, under substantially weaker conditions than
those previously imposed. Our formulation further allows for the coupling
variable to follow a more general Gaussian mixture distribution, and we
provide a novel third-order coupling method which gives tighter
approximations in certain settings.
We specialize our main result to mixingales, martingales, and independent
data, and derive uniform Gaussian mixture strong approximations for
martingale empirical processes. Applications to nonparametric
partitioning-based and local polynomial regression procedures are provided.
