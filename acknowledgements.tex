I am extremely fortunate to have been surrounded by many wonderful people during
my Ph.D. at Princeton; without their support this dissertation
would not have been possible. While it is impossible to identify every one of
them, I would like to mention just a few names in particular.

Firstly, I would like to express my utmost gratitude to my adviser,
Matias Cattaneo. Working with Matias has been a thoroughly rewarding start to my
journey as a researcher, during which he has been in equal measure inspiring,
insightful, dedicated, understanding, and, above all, kind.

Secondly, I would like to thank all of the faculty members at
Princeton and beyond who have acted as my collaborators and mentors.
In particular, my PhD committee members
Jianqing Fan and Jason Klusowski,
my coauthors Yingjie Feng and Ricardo Masini,
my dissertation reader Boris Hanin,
and my master's supervisor Mihai Cucuringu.
