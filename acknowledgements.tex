I am extremely fortunate to have been surrounded by many wonderful people during
my Ph.D. at Princeton; without their support this dissertation
would not have been possible. While it is impossible to identify every one of them,
I would like to mention a few names in particular.

Firstly, I would like to express my utmost gratitude to my adviser,
Matias Cattaneo.
